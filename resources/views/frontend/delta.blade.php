            <p>We all get up and go to work but when we are asked why we do we get different answers from each of us but everyone goes to work every day to achieve happiness, peace, prosperity and success . There is a lot of work going on in everyday life. Yet we always feel that we are missing something in life. Happiness, peace, prosperity and success are not enough for us in life. Delta Circle helps our life to fill this void.<br />
The question we get here is what is a delta circle? The Delta Circle is a source of happiness, peace, prosperity and success. Which serves to give direction to our lives. The seven layers of the delta circle are the task of evaluating our life and giving the right direction to be happy.</p>

<p>Who can use Delta Circle?</p>

<p>Delta Circle can be helpful to anyone who works from morning to evening with the desire to achieve something in life. Delta Circle Student Jobs, Professional, or Business Everybody should learn and create. Provides guidance on what can be used to accomplish the objectives. Let&#39;s try to understand the player.</p>

<p><br />
<!-- <strong>7 layers of Delta Circle </strong></p> -->

<p><br /><strong>My Outer World </strong></p>

<p>This is the seventh layer of the delta circle. My outside world means the people we meet, family members, relatives, things, cars, bungalows, things in front of our eyes, the world we are seeing, feeling, what we want to achieve. The dreams, the goals, the desires, the dreams we have to achieve are all in this outside world. Every human being living in this world works here all his life with the desire to achieve something. Even at the end of life, we are still counting how much we have achieved in the world.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Body </strong></p>

<p>The sixth layer of the body delta circle if we want to achieve something in life, then the body also has to function. Exercise, yoga, pranayama, food, whatever we do at the body level, in short, we expend our inner energy wherever we use the body for work. Our body can give us a lot if it is used with the right understanding that it is our biggest capital. Because when we understand the field of energy, the body is our instrument. Its use can create a lot in the world. Only through him can we give our desired replay on everything in the world. If our energy is wasted in the body, it can be saved and used for the attainment of our goals.</p>

<p><strong>The five senses</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Our five senses are the fifth layer of the delta circle. As ordinary human beings we use our five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching) to convey any information of the world to our brain. All the means of marketing that are being used around the world are being taken with these five senses in mind. Our energy is expended whenever we become aware of any information using these five senses. The energy that we could use to achieve our goals. The present is known as the age of IT. The company that has the most data i.e. information that company is getting bigger day by day. Achieving our goals can be very easy if we learn to use our five senses properly and manage them properly.</p>

<p><strong>Continuse emotions</strong></p>

<p>The flowing emotions are the fourth layers of the delta circle. These layers are also very important because it is said that we live in an ocean of emotions. The world we live in is called the price world. In our daily life our emotions are constantly going up and down. Sometimes we are very happy, sometimes we are very sad, sometimes we are angry, sometimes we are very happy. Thus, the process of our emotions continues. The more often we respond emotionally, the more we expend our inner energy, the more we respond to the kind of emotions we have towards our goal or objectives, which is seen to affect the ultimate outcome of our objectives. Thus, if we become aware of our emotions, we will be able to bring positive results in our results.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our daily lives, our emotions go from top to bottom. Sometimes we are very happy, sometimes we are very sad. Thus the feeling process continues. Here too our energy is expended.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts of the future</strong></p>

<p>We are engaged in thoughts of the future. We constantly keep our thoughts on the small things connected with the future even as we leave home to go to the office for a job or business. We have not yet left home to reach the office, but we reach the office with the mind. Thus we are constantly engaged in thoughts of the future. Here, too, our inner energies are expended. There are many things in which we are unnecessarily preoccupied with our future. Thus, the energy that should be used for our happiness, success, prosperity and peace of mind is being expended here.</p>

<p>We are constantly engaged in thoughts of the future. We get there from the mind before we leave home to go to the office for work or business and physically reach the place of work. Thus constant future thoughts use our energy which energy should be used for our happiness success, prosperity and peace of mind.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts of the past</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts of the past another layer of the delta circle is our past, but often our minds are stuck there. Many good and bad things have happened to us in the past. His experiences are constantly connected to us. If someone has insulted us or harmed us, any negative event has happened, even though a lot of time has passed in such matters, our energy is expended because it is alive inside us. The negative consequences of which we have to suffer.</p>

<p>Thus, the energy that is expended in the layers of the delta circle. If we want to achieve our goal easily, we must be smart after understanding the delta circle. If we are smart, we should minimize the layers in between so that we can easily reach our goals if our inner energy reaches directly to our outer world.</p>

<p>There are people in our world whose energy is not expended in any of these layers. Even in their outer world, they have no energy. There are true saints or elders who have a lot of sympathy for us. When we go among such people, their energy falls on our outer world. Due to which our goal achieves a good amount of positive energy, we achieve it quickly so we should stay in the company of such people. Thus, we have to create our delta circle and work on it. Which in this Delta Circle Practical Workshop we are going to learn what we should do to save energy being wasted unnecessarily and flow towards our goal.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the past Good experiences are seldom remembered in our past experiences. But we are constantly reminded of weak experiences. All of these thoughts constantly use up our energy whether we have been insulted or harmed by someone or any negative event. Which wastes our energy?</p>

<p><strong>Thoughtless process</strong></p>

<p>The last is also a very important and important circle from where energy flows. There is our soul. The state of thoughtlessness is called Thoughtless Awastha. If we save the energy expended in these five layers between My Outer World Thoughtless, it will be very helpful in achieving our goal in the Outer World. How to save the energy expended in these layers. Let&rsquo;s understand how to be and get help in fulfilling our dreams.</p>
